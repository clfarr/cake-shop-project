# üç∞ Sweet Treats Cake Shop

## Overview/Description
Sweet Treats Cake Shop is an interactive web application that allows users to search for cake images and GIFs using the Giphy API. This project was created as part of a software engineering bootcamp to demonstrate proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API integration, and responsive web design.

Users can enter keywords like "birthday cake," "chocolate cake," or "cupcakes" and instantly see a beautiful grid of animated cake images pulled from Giphy's extensive library.

## How to Use
1. Open the website in your browser
2. Type a cake-related search term in the search box (e.g., "wedding cake", "cupcakes", "chocolate cake")
3. Click the "Search" button
4. Browse through the displayed cake images in the grid layout
5. The site is fully responsive - try it on your phone or tablet!
